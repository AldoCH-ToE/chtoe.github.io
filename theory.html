  <h1>The Theory</h1>
  <p>The Cernuto-Hobbey Theory of Everything proposes that structured knowledge—not energy or matter—is the foundational substance of reality.</p>
  <p>CH-ToE defines knowledge as structured entropy reduction and introduces λ as the universal cadence by which systems transition into structured reality.</p>
